Hello, thanks for checking my stuff out. All of the code here was done solo.


FidgetEngine:
Basic game engine made in C++. It has some very basic networking. It also includes a basic game to demonstrate the engine's capabilities. There's some basic documentation that you can browse via index.html.
Project Length: 1 week

HighTailsEditor:
This is a snippet from the level editor code created for a tactics RPG, High Tails and Low Blows.
Project Length: A few days

HighTailsGame:
This is the near-complete code for High Tails. I tried removing all of the Debug lines, but you may encounter some anyway. Sorry about that.
Project Length: 2 months
